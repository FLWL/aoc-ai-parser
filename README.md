# aoc-ai-parser
Scripts for generating random AoC AIs, saving them as .per files and parsing .per files into tree structures.

# Notes
* As of now, this only saves the generated AIs in a valid .per format, but cannot actually load any existing AI because of the incomplete AI language definitions in ai_constants.py

# Example visualized AI rule tree
